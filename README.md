## COVID-19 Vaccination Database Modelling

This was my submission for my database course' final assignment (June 2023). The requirements were as follows:
1. Designing the database
2. Scripting to import data from CSV files into tables in the DB (Database.sql in the repo)
3. Retrieving data through queries and visualising said data through tableau (refer queries.pdf in the repo for queries and their visualisations)
